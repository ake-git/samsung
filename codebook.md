## CODEBOOK

See readme.md to find out what data transformations the script performs and how.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

For each record it is provided:
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
* Activity label. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables (average values calculated for each subject and each activity).
Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

Transformations performed to clean up the data:
* merging data sets (by columns or rows)
* labeling variables and values (from provided files)
* extracting specified columns from the data set
* grouping the data set by specified variables
* summarising variables by specified categories

**The data set includes 68 variables:**
```
subject (subjects labels: from 1 to 30)
activity (activity labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
```
And average of each variable (included in train and test sets, but only mean and standard deviation measures) calculated for each activity and each subject:
